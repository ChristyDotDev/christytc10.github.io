This is just to test out posting a blog entry as R Markdown since I've been mucking about
with R to do some data analysis and visualisation. 

This is just a simple script which basically assigns a variable named test. Here I'm setting it
to a simple vector with a couple dummy values

```{r}
test <- c("val1", "val2")
```
