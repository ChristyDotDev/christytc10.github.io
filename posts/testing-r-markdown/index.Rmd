Describe what we're going to try and do

```{r}
library(ffscrapr)
```

Do something here with the league connection

```{r}
league <- sleeper_connect(season = 2021, league_id = 649923060580864000)
```

```{r}
rosters <- ff_rosters(league)
print(rosters)
```

TODO - let's show something useful you can do with this data to look at your team
