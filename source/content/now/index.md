# Now 
###### Updated 07/04/2021
Inspired by Derek Siverâ€™s idea of a ["now"](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

Just a rough update of what I'm up to 

### Life

I'm staying in Dunfermline with my girlfriend Jeni and our dog Lola. Been enjoying having a
garden and shed to tinker in; thankfully haven't had to commute into Edinburgh yet.

### Work

I'm working as a Senior Backend Software Engineer at FanDuel, mostly writing Java services
but have started doing a bit more Python as well. 

### Reading/Listening

Today I finished ["How to build a Car"](https://www.waterstones.com/book/how-to-build-a-car/adrian-newey/9780008196806) by Adrian Newey. I went in kind of blind and didn't realise it
was a memoir but I ended up quite enjoying it. Not sure what I'll read next.

Also been listening to the [Revolutions](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) podcast 
by Mike Duncan but I paused that for now because I quite like to listen to a few episodes in a row and I had caught up.

### Projects

Working on this website a little.

Been tinkering with the PC game Assetto Corsa lately, started looking into creating
an app within the game that could do something fun with the in-game data. I did a proof-of-concept
of something [similar](https://github.com/christytc10/f12020-twitch) before with an F1 game.
