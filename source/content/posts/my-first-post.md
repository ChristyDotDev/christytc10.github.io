Creating this site/blog mostly as a learning exercise. I've got a few wee sideprojects
going but I want to start to get more focused in finishing/publishing them. At worst,
it'll be some environmental storytelling chronicling my slow(ish) descent into madness.

I think posts will take the format of see one, do one, teach one where I try and show my
thinking and working with new stuff. I'm a backend/Java dev by trade so most of the 
hobby projects I tinker with are very different to that
