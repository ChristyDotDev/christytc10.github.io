<p>This is just to test out posting a blog entry as R Markdown since I’ve been mucking about
with R to do some data analysis and visualisation.</p>
<p>This is just a simple script which basically assigns a variable named test. Here I’m setting it
to a simple vector with a couple dummy values</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test &lt;- c(&quot;val1&quot;, &quot;val2&quot;)</code></pre>
